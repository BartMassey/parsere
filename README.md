# parsere / parsere-derive: regex-based struct parsing for Rust programs
Bart Massey

The `parsere` Rust crate is intended to allow easy parsing
of text into a struct using a regular expression. The
`parsere-derive` crate does most of the work using a
procedural derive macro.

This code is very much a work-in-progress. It seems to be
working, but needs a complete API redesign and then some
documentation.
